          <h5>My name is Sharon Choi, I’m a UX/UI designer with a background in hospitality.</h5>
          <h5>I’m commited to my design journey and would love to share my passion with you.</h5>

      <section class="about-main">
        <h3 class="title">Along the way</h3>
        <p>Growing up as a quiet kid, I loved to listen and observe. At my young age, I showed traits of being passionate about design. I was so fascinated when my dad, who is an architect and interior designer, presented me with a stack of color samples and gave me the authority to pick a color palette for my bedroom.

          <br/></br>Studying hospitality management in Switzerland, and my eye-opening journey of working with people from different cultures was a turning point in life. There I developed interpersonal skills and a problem-solving mindset. “Treat others the way you would like to be treated” summarizes what I learned from my hotel career. I trusted that being empathetic, willing to listen and paying attention to details were the golden rules of creating an above-and-beyond experience for guests. This philosophy has stuck with me and shaped the way I work in UX Design. </p>

        <h3 class="title">Finding the right path</h3>
        <h5 class="add-margin bio-quote">“My early career and passion in technology have guided me through the path of UX design”</h5>
        <p>After 8 years of my career, I took a step back to rethink what I wanted to accomplish. Although I have excelled in different roles within the hotel industry, I was not excited about my achievements and I was losing momentum from the routine. At the same time, my creative itch was whispering and needed a scratch. When I was a sales coordinator, I enjoyed working on layouts and content hierarchy for sales collateral. I am a perfectionist who would dig into text alignment and spacing to ensure my work was visually appealing and easy to understand.

        <br/></br>When I moved from Hong Kong to San Francisco in 2016, I had the opportunity to attend various technology talks and became aware of coding as a marketable skill. Coding reminded me of a rewarding experience at high school when I designed my very first bus navigation website with Dreamweaver (without knowing HTML and CSS!). Back then, I couldn’t usually endure long hours of study, but my passion for the work helped me persist. To my surprise, I received the highest score in the class.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">High-tech vs. High-touch</h3>
        <p>Eager to expand my knowledge, I started to teach myself basic HTML & CSS, participated in coding workshops, and completed a 4-week course focused on Javascript. These mind-blowing experiences boosted my confidence in pursuing a career in the technology field. That said, I am a people person who is more curious about the “why” than the “how” when it comes to problem-solving. By expressing my interest to my mentor and researching the industry, I discovered UX design. I found UX design to be a perfect extension of what I have brought together from my previous experience – a desire to understand people’s needs and come up with solutions that best fit their needs. More importantly, it fulfills my passion for design and technology.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Embarking on my design journey</h3>
        <p class="last-p">I know self-discipline and persistence are the keys to overcome challenges that come with career transition. While maintaining a full-time job, I decided to commit to a remote apprenticeship program offered by Bloc to facilitate effective learning. Throughout the program, I was immersed in a community of designers while being mentored by industry veterans who helped me learn to think analytically. From researching and mind-mapping to wireframing and testing, I mastered different phases of the design process by working on design projects that required me to solve real-world problems.</p>

          <h5 class="add-margin bio-quote">I believe less is more in everything I do. I pursue quality over quantity in my design.</h5>
          <p class="last-p">I love the energy of the city vibe, as well as the calmness of nature. My life goal is to stay healthy and active. In my spare time, I like to find inspirations for healthy eating, fitness, beauty, as well as home decor through YouTube, Pinterest or other design blogs. Practicing yoga, traveling and indulging myself with great food are my ways to de-stress and connect with new people.</p>
