          <h6 class="title">Problems</h6>
          <p>Among various leading platforms in the cloud storage service market, some of them specialize in file backup, while the others focus on note-taking and file organization. Users are often frustrated with switching between platforms to achieve different goals in their personal and professional lives. Additionally, the existing platforms are somewhat lacking an intuitive interface for content sharing and collaboration in a social aspect.</p>

          <p>Seamhub is a cloud storage and content management web application that offers a unified solution to empower work efficiency and ideas sharing. Users can store and organize files, save contents from the internet, create simple notes, and collaborate with others in one single place.</p>

          <p>Based on my research findings, I pinned down the project direction:</p>
          <ol>

            <li>The interface and user experience should be simple and convenient focused.</li>
            <li>Users should be able to use the application in both their professional and personal lives.</li>
            <li>The user flow for saving and organizing weblinks should be streamlined.</li>
            <li>The application should allow users to back up and synchronizing files, especially images.</li>
            <li>Collaboration features are nice-to-have, but not essential.</li>

            <p>Kelly wants to save inspiration from the internet and take notes of her ideas on the go with her mobile. She also wants to be able to organize and share her thoughts with friends effectively.</p>

          <p>Given the cloud storage service market has been established for almost a decade, there are multitudinous brands entered the market, some leading platforms, like Google Drive, icloud, Dropbox, Evernote and Pinterest, are dominating and taking up the most market shares, along with smaller businesses, like SugarSync, Carbonite and Mozy, that are evolving. While these platforms possess unique value and shortfall, I focused my analysis on two cloud-storage-based applications, Dropbox and iCloud, as well as a content capture and organization oriented application, Pinterest, in order to penetrate a broader range of business setting.
          <p>Through SWOT analysis and a closer examination to the established user flows of these competitors, I was able to leverage the value-added features and growth opportunities into my design, while sidestepping those problems that composed user’s frustrations.</p>

          <p>From the perspective of each user types, new users and returning users, I compiled a list of tasks as goals that I wanted to accomplish with my product. I flagged the essential tasks as the minimum viable product (MVP) and prioritized them according to their level of necessity to the project.</p>
          <p>I then focused on mapping out the most intuitive paths for the high prioritized tasks which include the processes of on-boarding, account upgrade, file upload, and organization, as well as content saving from the internet. I crafted a sitemap to manage the overall structure and content hierarchy of the site.</p>

          <p>Having set out the foundation,  I moved onto laying out the skeletal framework, targeted the MVP by revisiting my user stories, user flows, and sitemap. I utilized papers and pencil to sketch out different variations of the landing page, dashboard, and several task-oriented pages. The goal was to rapidly iterate my ideas before pinning down to a single direction.</p>
          <p>Once I settled in the direction, I brought my rough drafts to Balsamiq, where I developed my low-fidelity prototypes, and subsequently to Sketch and InVision, where I created a clickable prototype for user testing.</p>

          <h4 class="sub-title">Mind-mapping and word association</h4>
          <p>Stability and security play a big part in the world of cloud storage and organization service, therefore, when it comes to branding, the first thing crossed my mind were trustworthiness and professionalism. Meanwhile, as more and more users are bringing these applications to their personal and social lives, I decided the brand should also be lifestyle-friendly and energetic. These concepts shaped the tone and voice of my brand.</p>
          <p>I went on mind-mapping and playing around different word combinations based on the concepts of easy, secure, unified and modern. While I came across with different compositions, I decided to lock down Seamhub as the brand name.</p>
          <div class="link">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BwIDf-vk57X_n3HqeUNxGUUMuGlKk14tun3J89IFVok/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Take a look at my mind map <i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></a>
          </div>
          <p>With the brand identity getting in shape, I began to sketch out different variations of objects that I found relevant to the brand. The concepts of a puzzle, gear wheel, lightbulb, rooftop, and pocket have initially reached my mind. I was eventually attracted by the simplicity of logotypes and tried out twisting the brand initials (S & H), to meet the goal of creating a clean, modern and memorable logo.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-title">Engaging the potential users to find out their preference and taste</h4>
            <p>I utilized preference test on Usability Hub to experiment user’s preferences on three areas: hero images, call-to-action button layout, and icon colors. Here is one of the highlight:</p>
            <div id="ab-screen">
              <h5>Call-To-Action Button Layout</h5>
              <div id="screen-a">

                <img src="images/projects/seamhub/preference-test-screen-a.png" alt="Screen A" height="340" width="504">
                <h1>47%</h1>
                <p>of users liked this design mainly because:</p>
                <p>“All options are available in once” <br>“Less clicking time”</p>
              </div>
              <div id="screen-b">
                <h6>Screen A<br>Minimized layout</h6>
                <img src="images/projects/seamhub/preference-test-screen-b.png" alt="Screen B" height="332" width="492">
                <h1>53%</h1>
                <p>of users liked this design mainly because:</p>
                <p>“Space used effectively” <br>“Larger preview box”</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>Taking into consideration the percentage difference between these two designs was not statistically significant, I decided to consolidate the positive comments from each design and create a new variation for further testing.</p>

            <h6 class="title">User Testing 2nd Round</h6>
            <h4 class="sub-title">Gaining additional insight from users</h4>
            <p>I conducted another round of testing with three users via zoom conferencing. I explicitly reached out to individuals who have not participated in any of my earlier tests to get fresh pairs of eyes on my designs. </p>
            <p>Delightly, all users had a positive impression on the visual design and layout of the site. They described the experience as seamless, intuitive, and easy to follow. During the tests, users were asked to perform a series of tasks based on the MVPs. On-boarding processes appeared to be a no-brainer, from which all of the users were able to complete basic action-oriented tasks, like uploading items and creating folders, effortlessly.</p>
            <p>However, the added quick button panel did not work out as expected. While I intended to allow users more immediate access to the frequently used action buttons, I carefully examined user's interaction with the site and realized that the design was not as constructive as I thought. Without an explicit instruction of how the button works, users were confused. </p>
            <p>Another shortcoming that drew my attention was how users anticipate saving a web link. I focused on finding out the solution for the problems and composed list of action items for fine-tuning my final product.</p>

          <h3 class="heading">Summary</h3>
          <p>For the fact that this was the very first time I take charge of a UX Design project, the learning curve has been steep, yet incredible. From start to finish, I took total control of the discovery, strategy, information architecture, branding, visual design, and the examination process.</p>
          <div>
            <h6 class="title">What I have learned</h6>
            <h4 class="sub-title">User research is crucial</h4>
            <p>I was amazed by how user research has impacted the direction of the project. With the project starting off with lots of unanswered questions, it got into shape as I moved along the process of surveying users, understanding the competitors, identifying MVPs, creating brand identity, wireframing, prototyping, and more importantly user testings. The project would have gone for an entirely different route if I didn’t engage with the users.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6 class="title">What I could do better</h6>
            <h4 class="sub-title">What I like ≠ What users like</h4>
            <p>There were so many instances from which my anticipations were not the same as my users, not to mention that the solution I crafted may not be the best fit to user’s needs. This principle becomes more perceptible to me as I tested out my design with users.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="sub-title">Test early test often</h4>
            <p>If I had more time and resources, I would have conducted more extensive testings during the phase of wireframing to fix all the structural and layout problems at an earlier stage.  Not only I would have a stronger foundation for my design decision, but also I could focus more on the visual and interactive aspects during my later tests.  While I have accomplished the MVPs of this project, if I continued to build out the identified collaboration features, as well as any discovery identified along the way, there would be tremendous opportunities for this project to shine.</p>
